# Vertebral

Vertebral is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Check out https://github.com/jkernech/vertebral for documentation and details.

## Getting started

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/jkernech/vertebral.git`
Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Why it's awesome

Vertebral is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.

- Around 800 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS

## What differs from Skeleton ?

- A lot of fixes have been incorporated (cf. [Skeleton issues](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/issues))
- Integrate normalize.css 
- Styles for android / ios / wp platforms

## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
